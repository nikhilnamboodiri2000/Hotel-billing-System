# Hotel-billing-System

A C++ program which implements a billing system.
This was my class 11 computer project in C++.In this program,i have implemented a billing system for a restaurant.The user is required to enter his/her first and last name following which a menu card is printed displaying all items available and their price in serial number.A total of 13 items are included in the menu and the user is free to choose as many items any number of times.Once the user selects 14 a bill is printed showing the original amount and the estimated bill including all taxes.
